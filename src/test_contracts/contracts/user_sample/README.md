# User Sample Contract

User sample contract is a contract that represents a third party and is meant to perform user actions in tests like register interchain queries, interact with interchaintxs module and handle corresponding callbacks. To do so, you should instantiate the contract and interact with Neutron's interchainqueries/txs modules on its behalf.
